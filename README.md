# Notes
Product prices are saved in database as INTEGER as best practice in banking and payment gateway systems (i.e. 12.25 is saved as 1225).

In Postman you can find a collection with login method, product list and insert shopping cart samples.

Database is set up using liquibase with preloaded products.

In **/sales-business/src/test/java** you can find unit tests.
